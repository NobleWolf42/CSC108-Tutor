2.25 C++ example: Married-couple names with variables
zyDE 2.25.1: Married-couple names with variables.
Pat Smith and Kelly Jones are engaged. What are possible last name combinations for the married couple (listing Pat first)?
1. Run the program below to see three possible married-couple names. Note the use of variable firstNames to hold both first names
of the couple.
2. Extend the program to declare and use a variable lastName similarly. Note that the output statements are neater. Run the program
again.
3. Extend the program to output two more options that abut the last names, as in SmithJones and JonesSmith. Run the program
again.
